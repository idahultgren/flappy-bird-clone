# flappy-bird-clone
A simple clone of the flappy bird game. "Fly" the bird up by using spacebar and try to get past the pipes. Touch the pipes, the top or bottom of the world and you lose. It keeps track of how many pipes you have cleared by counting how many pipes gets removed when they leave the screen, it gets displayed when you lose.

Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

This was my first time using git commands in the terminal and push the changes to the repository. Before I have uploaded the files manually when I was done. I worked with game loops, modules and rects. I also got a better understanding on how the set css-variables and styles using JavaScript with setPoperty and getPropertyValue on the style and getComputedStyle.
